This tool works as a Nodes Watchdog and Distributable Log Analyser.

Generally speaking,
this toolkit provides an intergrated web interface where you can add/delete/configure/monitor nodes via ssh protocol, operated by backend, 
and modules(like log analyser) can be distributed and executed, whose results will be notified in the frontend afterward.

This project is in early development, please come back later.
